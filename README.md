# Full-Stack-Data-Science-Project
data scrapping + apache airflow + ETL + pyspark + ML + prediction/reporting 


Having an sharable idea building an full-stack datascience engine from 0 to 1.
Would include phases:
phase 1:Deep understand business logics for Wholesalers in mechanical manufacture
phase 2:Design entire engine by flow charts
phase 3:Preparation and Skill improvement
phase 4:Public web pooling scrapping NoSQL data, NLP data, ecommerce data, social media data
phase 5:TBD


Currently my thoughts were at phase 4, would sharing more along with entire project moves.

Final idea: build A.I. industrial related information and data gathering hub, and push analytics accordingly


Any thoughts and communications are super welcomed. Hopefully I could finish by my own. Hahahahaha
